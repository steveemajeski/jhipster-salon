# jhipster-salon
Full Stack Java Booking Platform for Local Commerce Reservations Test Bed with JHipster, Docker, Spring and Microservices

Welcome to the Salon!  This repository should have been named jhipster-salon-sandbox as it is a bit early in my JHipster, Docker, Spring and Microservices workbench development.  If you are interested in experimenting with the JHipster technology stack this is the place.  https://jhipster.github.io/  If you are interested in using and deploying automatically generated web sites we have a chair for you. I decided to try to solve a real business problem with this test bed so I could evaluate the tech stack in a disciplined manner.  Simply stated: "I want to schedule a hair cut appointment using my smartphone without making a phone call to my salon."  

Doesn't sound too radical does it?   I am a pretty laid back hipster!  But being laid back does not mean that I am idlle.  I am willing to do the software for free, open source just to see if it is possible with the current tech stacks.  I recommend Matt Raible's book: https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/jhipster-2-mini-book 
if you are interested in UI modifications and JHipster's frameworks.  I was last a committer to DDF - Distributed Data Framework Home - Codice Foundation .

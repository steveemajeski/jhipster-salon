Full Stack Java Booking Platform for Local Commerce Reservations with Docker, Spring and Microservices Test Bed

Welcome to the salon!

If you are interested in experimenting with the JHipster technology stack this is the place.
https://jhipster.github.io/

If you are interested in using and deploying functional Docker, Spring and Microservices we have a chair for you.

I decided to try to solve a real business problem with this test bed so I could evaluate the tech stack in a disciplined manner.

Simply stated: "I want to schedule a hair cut appointment using my smartphone without making a phone call to my salon."

"I want to make a tee time at my local golf course for my three buddies from my office browser and get email confirmations."

"I want to make a dinner reservation at my local restaurant from my home browser."

Doesn't sound too radical does it?  I am a pretty laid back hipster!  But being laid back does not mean that I am idlle.  I am willing to do the software for free, open source just to see if it is possible with the current tech stacks.

Please help me with some commits.  I recommend Matt Raible's book: https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/jhipster-2-mini-book 
if you are interested in UI and JHipster's frameworks.

I was last a committer to DDF - Distributed Data Framework Home - Codice Foundation .

I have already arranged for a real world integration laboratory in Centereach "Long Guyland" New York USA.

There is some real urgency however.  Donald Trump is POTUS and when I tweeted him about the "Two China Policy" he took me literally.

Sorry in advance to everyone....
